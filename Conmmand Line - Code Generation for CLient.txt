-- Run this instruction on VS Command Line

Example:
svcutil /directory:"C:/svcutil_Test" /target:code  /language:C# http://localhost:50613/MyFirstService.svc?wsdl

Switch						Behavior																			Shortcut
/directory:<directory>		Specifies the output directory in which the generated files will be placed.			/d
							If no value is specified, it uses the current directory for the output. 
							If the directory has already been used, output will be overwritten if the 
							utility is run with this switch.											

/help						Shows the available command-line options. Very unlikely to appear on the test,		/?
							but if it does, something in the stem will mention “help” or indicate “you need 
							to list the available command-line options for Svcutil.exe, which of the 
							following….”

/noLogo						Suppresses the “Logo” information (copyright and banner message).					N/A

/svcutilConfig:<configFile>	Puts the configuration information in a file other than the default App.config		N/A
							file. You can also use this option to register the <system.ServiceModel> elements 
							without changing the tool’s configuration file.

/async						Creates the proxy class with both standard and asynchronous method signatures.		/a
							By default, just the standard method signatures are included, so if you see any 
							indication that the asynchronous methods need to be included, anything without 
							the /async option will not be the answer.

/internal					Generates the methods using the internal access modifier instead of generating		/i
							them as public.

/target:<output type>		Instructs the tool to create a specific output. You can use one of three options:	/t
							code, metadata, xmlSerializer

/language:<language>		Instructs the tool to create a specific output for an spcific language.				/l
							You can use: "C#" or "VB".
